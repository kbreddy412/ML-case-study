# Case Study

### Problem Area	
Recommender System

### Dataset	
The dataset is collected from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service.

### Code	
We already have a code from Data Scientist for recommender model but available within notebook.

### Functional/Non-Functional Requirements	
1.	Create a recommendation system design which will give movie recommendation to logged in user based on preferences and past watch history.
2.	Recommendations should refresh within 5min window.
3.	Need to productionize this solution at scale with QPS of approx. 1000.

**Note**: No need of end-to-end code, design and templatization would be enough.

### What is required from this case Study?	
As a Solution Architect for this case study, candidate need **to provide high level architecture which address following questions**:
1.	What should be the Python code template?
2.	CI/CD strategy for ML use cases
3.	Model monitoring and drift detection.
4.	Offline/Online evaluation
5.	Training/Tuning/Inference and cluster strategy.
